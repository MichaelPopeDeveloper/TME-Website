<br>
<br>
 We call <span class="blue">Trickle Up Economics!</span> Creating Opportunity from the <strong>Bottom Up!</strong>
<br />
<br />
The <strong>Massive</strong> Number of People affected in Communities Across the Country is the Source of Every Community’s <span class="blue">Greatest Strength</span> in the <span class="green">NTF!</span>  For that reason, Among Many Others, <span class="green">“Enlistment”</span> on Any Level, is Paramount.
<br>

    <h1 id="main-content-h1">SUPPLEMENT YOUR INCOME</h1>
    <p id="p-1">The <strong>Innovation</strong> of Social Enterprise allows our <strong>Independent Business Owners</strong> (IBO Members) to <span class="blue">Supplement</span> Their Income or Run Their Own Business! 
      <br>
      <br>
For Example, an Economic Commitment of <Strong>$25/mo.</Strong> from approximately <span class="green"><strong>6,000 NTF Members</strong></span> creates an <span class="blue">Economic Impact</span> of <strong>$150,000/mo.</strong> for Your Local Area.  
<br>
<br>
In addition to Building the <strong>Initial</strong> Infrastructure for  Job Creation, the <span class="blue">Immediate Benefit</span> is the Creation of a <span class="green">Revenue Flow</span> of approximately <strong>$22,500/mo</strong>. ($270,000/yr.).
<br>
<br>
 This is paid Directly to <strong>IBO MEMBERS</strong> (Independent Business Owners) that Helped Create It.   
<br>
<br>
<strong>$150,000</strong> Creates this <span class="green">ECONOMIC CYCLE</span> Directly in Disenfranchised Communities!
<br>
<br>
With <span class="blue">ECONOMIC PATRIOT</span> MEMBERS ALONE, Communities have More than Enough Collective <span class="green">Economic Power</span> to Far Surpass this Initial Level!  
<br>
<br>
<strong>STRONG</strong> Community Participation on <strong>ANY</strong> Level OPENS the DOOR for Social Impact Investors, Micro Philanthropic Donors, Matching Corporate Funds and More!  These groups are Ready and Willing to <span class="green">Join Communities</span> that take an <span class="blue">Active Role</span> in their own Recovery. 

</p>
<h1 id="main-content-h1">COMMUNITY BENIFITS</h1>
<p id="p-1">Disenfranchised Communities have <strong>Always Possessed</strong> Collective Economic Spending Power.
<br>
<br>  
Those same Communities can now <span class="green">Reap Multiple Benefits</span> by Consolidating just a Small Portion of that Spending Power into a <span class="blue">Grassroots Movement</span> (NTF), Dedicated to <strong>Achieving</strong> Social and Economic Justice for All. 
  <br>
  <br>
Communities <span class="green">Coming Together,</span> Under the Umbrella of a <strong>GAME CHANGING</strong> Social Enterprise Blueprint, Designed to Create <span class="blue">Sustainable Empowerment.</span>  
</p>
  	   <!--  <p id="p-1">“ENTRY LEVEL Affiliates in the National Task Force are available for as little as $1-$25/mo.  Every Affiliate Member is important in several ways, regardless of the amount.  
<br />
<br />
This Level was established to Ensure Every Person Affected by disenfranchisement, would have the Opportunity to Actively Participate Socially and/or Economically, on some level, in their recovery.  “ENTRY LEVEL”  Affiliates are Invaluable Soldiers in the “Economic Army” of the National Task Force!</p>
 <h1 id="main-content-h1">Supplement Your Income</h1>
        <p id="p-1">With “ENTRY LEVEL Affiliates Alone, communities have more than enough “collective economic power” to meet the initial benchmark of $150,000/mo.  The immediate benefit is the creation a Revenue Stream of $270,000/yr. funded directly to IBO Affiliates (Independent Business Owners) in disenfranchised communities that Helped Create It.
<br />
<br />
The Innovation of Social Enterprise allows IBO Members the option of Supplementing their income by developing an Uber Style Revenue Stream for themselves, while helping to Rebuild Their Community.  For example, an Economic Commitment of $25/mo. from approximately 6,000 National Task Force Members creates an economic impact of $150,000/mo. for your local area. </p>
 <h1 id="main-content-h1">Helping Communities Help Themselves</h1>
        <p id="p-1">Second, building the Initial Infrastructure for sustainability and growth is next.  Social impact investors, micro philanthropic donors, matching corporate funds, EB-5 program and much more, are all part of a wide-ranging network of Long-Term Revenue Development.  These groups are ready and willing to Join Communities willing to help themselves by taking an Active Role in their own recovery.
<br />
<br />
Harnessing a very small portion of the Micro-Economic Spending Power of the community is key.   Every community, large or small, possesses this type of micro-economic spending power.  Now, communities have a “Game-Changing” opportunity to Socially and Economically Benefit from their Spending Power!</p>
<h1 id="main-content-h1">Comunity's Greatest Strength</h1>
        <p id="p-1">Disenfranchised communities have always possessed this tremendous “collective” economic spending power.  Those same communities can now Reap Multiple Benefits by consolidating just a small portion of that spending power into a Grassroots Movement, dedicated to achieving Social and Economic Justice for all.  Communities coming together under the umbrella of a Social Enterprise Blueprint designed to create Sustainable Empowerment. 
<br />
<br />
The Massive Number of people affected in communities across the country is the source of every community’s Greatest Strength!  For that reason, “Enlistment” into the National Task Force is Paramount to begin Large-Scale Social and  Economic Recovery Efforts in your area.</p>-->
