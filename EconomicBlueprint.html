       <h1 id="header-1">Economic Blueprint</h1>
    <h1 id="main-content-h1">COMMUNITY ASSETS</h1>
    <p id="p-1">
Social Enterprise Innovation allows Disenfranchised Communities to Take Advantage of their Most Powerful Assets!  The Millions of people Affected, their Families, and their Economic Spending Power! 
<br />
<br />
 “ENTRY LEVEL MEMBERSHIPS in the National Task Force are available for as little as $1-$25/mo.   Regardless of the Amount, Every Membership is Important!  Here’s why.
</p>
<h1 id="main-content-h1">NUMBERS ADVANTAGE</h1>
  <p id="p-1">
Every Person Affected by Disenfranchisement, (73 Million People + family) Should Have the Opportunity, to Actively Participate Socially and/or Economically, on some level, in their Recovery.
<br>
<br>
  “ENTRY LEVEL” Members are Invaluable Soldiers in the Social/Economic Army of the National Task Force!
<br />
<br />
Once Enlisted, You are now an Economic Advocate, adding Your Participatory Value (subscriber, membership, promotion, IBO, etc) to a Growing National Army! 
<br>
<br>
 Members can also Develop Revenue Sources that Enhance their “In the Trenches” Social Advocate Efforts as well.       
</p>
<h1 id="main-content-h1">REVENUE SYSTEM</h1>
  <p id="p-1">
Members can Participate in an Uber Style Revenue System just for Sharing Information!  This Creates an Immediate Financial Impact at the Grassroots Level while Adding Participatory Value to the Community! 
<br>
<br>
 This is called Trickle Up Economics!   Creating Opportunity from the Bottom Up!
<br />
<br />
The Massive Number of People affected in Communities Across the Country is the Source of Every Community’s Greatest Strength in the NTF!  For that reason, Among Many Others, “Enlistment” on Any Level, is Paramount.
<br>
<br>
 This INITIATES Large-Scale Social and Economic Recovery Efforts in Your Area.    
</p>
    <h1 id="main-content-h1">SUPPLEMENT YOUR INCOME</h1>
    <p id="p-1">The Innovation of Social Enterprise allows our Independent Business Owners (IBO Members) to Supplement Their Income or Run Their Own Business! 
      <br>
      <br>
For Example, an Economic Commitment of $25/mo. from approximately 6,000 National Task Force Members creates an Economic Impact of $150,000/mo. for Your Local Area.  
<br>
<br>
In addition to Building the Initial Infrastructure for  Job Creation, the Immediate Benefit is the Creation of a Revenue Flow of approximately $22,500/mo. ($270,000/yr.).
<br>
<br>
 This is paid Directly to IBO MEMBERS (Independent Business Owners) in the Disenfranchised Communities that Helped Create It.   
<br>
<br>
Each Benchmark of $150,000 Creates this ECONOMIC CYCLE Directly in Disenfranchised Communities!
<br>
<br>
With “ENTRY LEVEL MEMBERS ALONE, Communities have More than Enough “Collective Economic Power” to Far Surpass this Initial Level!  
<br>
<br>
STRONG Community Participation on ANY Level OPENS the DOOR for Social Impact Investors, Micro Philanthropic Donors, Matching Corporate Funds and More!  These groups are Ready and Willing to Join Communities that take an Active Role in their own Recovery. 

</p>
<h1 id="main-content-h1">COMMUNITY BENIFITS</h1>
<p id="p-1">Disenfranchised Communities have Always Possessed “Collective” Economic Spending Power.
<br>
<br>  
Those same Communities can now Reap Multiple Benefits by Consolidating just a Small Portion of that Spending Power into a Grassroots Movement (NTF), Dedicated to Achieving Social and Economic Justice for All. 
  <br>
  <br>
Communities Coming Together, Under the Umbrella of a GAME CHANGING Social Enterprise Blueprint, Designed to Create Sustainable Empowerment.  
</p>
  	   <!--  <p id="p-1">“ENTRY LEVEL Affiliates in the National Task Force are available for as little as $1-$25/mo.  Every Affiliate Member is important in several ways, regardless of the amount.  
<br />
<br />
This Level was established to Ensure Every Person Affected by disenfranchisement, would have the Opportunity to Actively Participate Socially and/or Economically, on some level, in their recovery.  “ENTRY LEVEL”  Affiliates are Invaluable Soldiers in the “Economic Army” of the National Task Force!</p>
 <h1 id="main-content-h1">Supplement Your Income</h1>
        <p id="p-1">With “ENTRY LEVEL Affiliates Alone, communities have more than enough “collective economic power” to meet the initial benchmark of $150,000/mo.  The immediate benefit is the creation a Revenue Stream of $270,000/yr. funded directly to IBO Affiliates (Independent Business Owners) in disenfranchised communities that Helped Create It.
<br />
<br />
The Innovation of Social Enterprise allows IBO Members the option of Supplementing their income by developing an Uber Style Revenue Stream for themselves, while helping to Rebuild Their Community.  For example, an Economic Commitment of $25/mo. from approximately 6,000 National Task Force Members creates an economic impact of $150,000/mo. for your local area. </p>
 <h1 id="main-content-h1">Helping Communities Help Themselves</h1>
        <p id="p-1">Second, building the Initial Infrastructure for sustainability and growth is next.  Social impact investors, micro philanthropic donors, matching corporate funds, EB-5 program and much more, are all part of a wide-ranging network of Long-Term Revenue Development.  These groups are ready and willing to Join Communities willing to help themselves by taking an Active Role in their own recovery.
<br />
<br />
Harnessing a very small portion of the Micro-Economic Spending Power of the community is key.   Every community, large or small, possesses this type of micro-economic spending power.  Now, communities have a “Game-Changing” opportunity to Socially and Economically Benefit from their Spending Power!</p>
<h1 id="main-content-h1">Comunity's Greatest Strength</h1>
        <p id="p-1">Disenfranchised communities have always possessed this tremendous “collective” economic spending power.  Those same communities can now Reap Multiple Benefits by consolidating just a small portion of that spending power into a Grassroots Movement, dedicated to achieving Social and Economic Justice for all.  Communities coming together under the umbrella of a Social Enterprise Blueprint designed to create Sustainable Empowerment. 
<br />
<br />
The Massive Number of people affected in communities across the country is the source of every community’s Greatest Strength!  For that reason, “Enlistment” into the National Task Force is Paramount to begin Large-Scale Social and  Economic Recovery Efforts in your area.</p>-->
