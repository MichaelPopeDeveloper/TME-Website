<h1 id="main-content-h1">MAXIMUM PARTICIPATION </h1>
<div id="p-container">
        <p id="p-1"><span class="blue">Social and Economic</span> Advocate Membership Levels are Designed for <strong>MAXIMUM</strong> Participation. Our Membership Foundation is based on the <strong>2 BIGGEST ADVANTAGES</strong> of Every Disenfranchised Community.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Micro Economic Spending Power of the <strong>MASSIVE</strong> Number of People Affected in Communities Across the Country.  
          <br />
          <br>
        As Participation <span class="green">INCREASES</span> on <strong>ANY</strong> Level, the <strong>Immediate</strong> <span class="blue">IMPACT</span> is Revenue Stream Developement, New Entrepreneurs, Initial Infrastructure and More!
        <br />
        <br>
        All Advocate Members can Develop Uber Style <strong>Compensation</strong> for 3 mo., 6 mo., or <strong>Long Term</strong> just for Sharing Information! 
         </p>
          <h1 id="main-content-h1">RAPID RESPONSE </h1>
        <p id="p-1"><span class="grenn">Social Advocates</span> are <strpng>Dedicated Servants</strpng> that want to take their <span class="blue">“Participatory Value”</span> in the Social Arena to the <strong>Next Level.</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
          They want to be on the <strong>Front Lines</strong> Working Directly with People in Need.                                           (volunteers, advisory/planning committees, non-profits, etc).
          <br />
          <br>
          The Need is so <span class="green">Massive</span> and <strong>GROWING</strong> at such a <strong>Rapid Pace,</strong> that <strong>Tens of Thousands of <span class="green">Social Advocates</span></strong> can be Developed Across the Country. This group can be EQUIPPED with the <span class="blue>">Resources</span> to Serve this Tremendous <strong>Social Crisis</strong> through Direct Services at the <strong>Grassroots Level.</strong>
        </p>
          <h1 id="main-content-h1">IN THE TRENCHES</h1>
        <p id="p-1">Social Advocates can Develop <strong>Uber Style</strong> Revenue Streams for Themselves/Organization while Helping to Create Numerous <span class="green">Social Services</span> Vital to a <strong>Successful Recovery</strong> of this population.    
          <br />
          <br>
      While Social Advocates <strong>Are</strong> Economic Advocates as well, their <span class="blue">Main Focus</span> is Fighting <strong>“In the Trenches”</strong> with the Ones They Serve.  Assisting them to <span class="green">Select</span> from among the many <strong>Options</strong> Available to <strong>Improve</strong> their Situation.</p>
      <h1 id="main-content-h1">ECONOMIC ARMY</h1>
        <p id="p-1"><span class="green">Economic Advocates</span> are Committed to <strong>Impacting</strong> their Community through <span class="blue">Membership</span> in one of 3 ways.
        <br>
        <br>
          You can simply be a <strong>Monthly Member</strong> at ANY Level.  You can be a <strong>Monthly Member</strong> who TELLS OTHER PEOPLE.  OR You can be a <strong>Monthly Member</strong> that <span class="green">Makes Money,</span> Telling Other People! 
          <br />
          <br>
          <strong>Strong</strong> Economic Advocate Memberships, <strong>Increases</strong> the <span class="blue">PACE and Sustainability</span> of Infrastructure Development.  For example, <strong>as Few as</strong> <span class="green">6,000 Economic Advocates,</span> can Develop the Infrastructure for the <span class="green">NEXT 100 Jobs</span> <strong>in Your Community!</strong>
          <br>
          <br>
            This would also Generate a New <span class="blue">Revenue Flow</span> of Tens of Thousands of Dollars/mo. into Local Communities! 
        </p>
         <h1 id="main-content-h1">NEW LEADERS EMERGING</h1>
        <p id="p-1">Economic Advocates are the <strong>NEW</strong> Community Leaders!   They have set the Bar at a <span class="blue">New Level</span> for others to <strong>Follow.</strong> This puts <span class="blue">Communities in Control</span> of their <strong>Recovery,</strong> through Participation in the <span class="green">Economic Army.</span>
          <br />
          <br>
         Economic Advocates can generate <span class="green">Uber Style Revenue Streams</span> for Themselves/Organization/Business. This <strong>Encourages Advocates</strong> to Increase <strong>Awareness</strong> of the <span class="blue">Tremendous Impact</span> Communities can achieve under this <span class="blue">Blueprint,</span> and <strong>GET PAID FOR IT!</strong>
         <br />
